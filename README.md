## Software Description

The **SESMG** is an energy system model generator with the focus on the optimization of urban energy systems, which can, however, also be used for the modeling of other types of energy systems. The **SESMG** is based on the 'Open Energy Modelling Framework' (oemof) and comes, compared to other modeling tools with advantages regarding user-friendliness, as
 
 * the model definition is based on spreadsheets, therefore no programming skills are required for the entire modeling process,
 * urban energy system models with any size can automatically conceptualized,
 * visualization of complex results are automatically created in the form of system graphs, Pareto-fronts, energy amounts, capacity diagrams, and many more, as well as
 * a set of standard (but still customizable) parameters are given, including detailed descriptions and references.
 
Furthermore, the **SESMG** comes with important modeling methods, enabling holistic modeling of spatially high resolution modeling of mixed-use multi energy systems, such as
 
 * considering the multi-energy system (MES) approach
 * applying multi-objective optimization by using the epsilon-constraint-method, as well as
 * providing several methods for model-based reduction of computational requirements (run-time and RAM).
