k_means,The k-means algorithm clusters the time periods (see period) in such a way; that the squared deviation of the cluster centers is minimal. From the time periods of one cluster the mean is calculated and returned as reference period of the cluster. For the decision the vector of a single parameter (see criterion) over the period duration is considered [1].,number of clusters to be considered. The number of clusters equals the number of returned reference days.,Clustering criterion to be considered (temperature; dhi; heat demand; electricity demand),Period length to be clustered (hours; days; or weeks),--

averaging, successive time periods (e.g. two consecutive days) are averaged and combined into one segment.,number of periods to be averaged,--,length of periods to be averaged (hours; days; weeks),--

slicing A, every n-th period is **selected and considered** within the modeling, index = n (every n-th period is selected in the modeling),--,length of periods to be sliced (hours; days; weeks),--

slicing B,every n-th period is **deleted and removed** from the modeling, index = n (every n-th period is removed),--,length of periods to be sliced (hours; days; weeks),--

downsampling A,Adaption of the temporal *resolution*. Every n-th period (selected by index column) is **used** for the modeling. For example; the resolution can be changed from a 1-hourly to a 3-hourly (index = 3) temporal resolution [1].,index = n (setting the new resolution),--,--,--

downsampling B, Adaption of the temporal *resolution*. Every n-th period (selected by index column) is **deleted** for the modeling. ,index = n (determination of the time steps to be deleted),--,--,--

heuristic selection,representative time periods of a time series are selected from certain selection criteria, applied selection scheme (available schemes are listed within the sesmg folder SESMG\program_files\technical_data\hierarchical_selection_schemes.xlsx,--,length of periods to be selected (days or weeks),--

random sampling,a given number of random periods are selected and used as representatives,number of periods to be selected.,--,length of periods to be selected randomly (days or weeks,--
