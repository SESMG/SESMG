Model Definition
================

For the modeling and optimization of an energy system, parameters for all system components must be given in the model 
generator using the enclosed .xlsx file (editable with Excel, LibreOffice, …). The .xlsx file is divided into nine 
input sheets. In the "energysystem" sheet, general parameters are defined for the time horizon to be examined, in the 
sheets "buses", "sinks", "sources", "transformers", "storages" and "links" corresponding components are defined. In 
the sheet "time series", the performance of individual components can be stored. In the "weather data" sheet, the 
required weather data is stored. When completing the input file, it is recommended to enter the energy system step by 
step and to perform test runs in between, so that potential input errors are detected early and can be localized more 
easily. In addition to the explanation of the individual input sheets, an example energy system is built step by step 
in the following subchapters. The input file for this example is stored in the program folder "examples" and viewed on 
`GitHub <https://github.com/chrklemm/SESMG_examples>`_. The following units are used throughout:

- capacity/performance in kW,
- energy in kWh,
- angles in degrees, and
- costs in cost units (CU).

Cost units are any scalable quantity used to optimize the energy system, such as euros or grams of carbon dioxide emissions.

.. _`Energysystem sheet`:

Energysystem
------------

Within this sheet, the time horizon and the temporal resolution of the model is
defined. The following parameters have to be entered:

- **start date**: Start of the modeling time horizon. Format: "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss";
- **end date**: End date of the modeling time horizon. Format: "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss"; and
- **temporal resolution**: For the modelling considered temporal resolution. Possible inputs: "a" (years), "d" (days),
  "h" (hours), "min" (minutes), "s" (seconds), "ms" (milliseconds). Attention: Make sure to write in lower case letters.
- **timezone**: By specifying the timezone, energy systems with correct time series (e.g. relevant for the correct balancing
  of the PV yield) can be modeled anywhere in the world. For this purpose, the pandas timezone string (e.g. Europe/Berlin) is
  inserted into the column. Then the weather data, which are available in the weather data sheet in UTC form, are corrected to
  the considered location.
- **periods**: Number of periods within the time horizon (one year with hourly resolution equals 8760 periods). Attention: Number
  of periods has to equal length of `Time series sheet`_ and `Weather data sheet`_.
- **cost limit** in (CU): Value in order to set a limit for the whole energysystem, e.g. monetary costs. Set this field to "None"
  in order to ignore the limit. If you want to set a limit, you have to set specific values for each components seen below.
- **constraint cost limit** in (CU): Value in order to set a limit for the whole energysystem, e.g. carbon dioxide emissions. Set
  this field to "None" in order to ignore the limit. If you want to set a limit, you have to set specific values for each
  components seen below.
- **minimum final energy reduction** in (kWh): This value can be used to define how much final energy reduction must be achieved.
  Thus, the optimization algorithm is forced to save at least <your_value_here> kWh of final energy amount. Currently only
  insulation investments can be used to achieve reductions. The “constraint2” factor of the insulation measures is 1, since every
  kWh saved by insulation measures is fully included in the savings. This value is set in the algorithm and can currently not be
  changed by the user.
- **weather data lat**: Latitude (WGS84) of the area under investigation. This value is used to import weather data from
  `Open Energy Platform <https://openenergy-platform.org>`_ using feedinlib's OpenFred.
- **weather data lon**: Longitude (WGS84) of the area under investigation. This value is used to import weather data from
  `Open Energy Platform <https://openenergy-platform.org>`_ using feedinlib's OpenFred.

Competition Constraints

it simply remains empty. To use this spreadsheet, the following values must be filled in:

- **label**: Unique designation of the competition constraint.
- **comment**: Space for an individual comment.
- **active**: Specifies whether the competition constraint shall be included to the model. "0" = inactive, "1" = active.

  <number> must be filled with consecutive integers (1, 2, 3...) for each row.
- **factor <number>**: Factor that defines how many units of the target unit component <number> needs to provide 1 kW of
  power. Attention: <number> must be filled with consecutive integers (1, 2, 3...) for each row.

  required to connect the exporting buses to the anergy network, requires a temperature difference, the operating temperature
  level of the heat bus to be connected must be specified here.

Timeseries
^^^^^^^^^^
If you have chosen the technology "timeseries" (in the technology column), you have to include a timeseries in the  `Time series sheet`_ or use default one.

Commodity
^^^^^^^^^
If you have chosen the technology "other" (in the technology column), a commodity
source with maximum investable capacity but completely variable time series becomes
part of the energy system. The solver can thus design a completely linear source
and use it to cover the demand when required.

.. _`Time series sheet`:

Time Series
-----------

Within this sheet, time series of components of which no automatically created time series exist, are stored. More 
specifically, these are sinks to which the property "load profile" have been assigned as "timeseries" and sources 
with the "technology" property "timeseries". The following parameters have to be entered:

- **timestamp**: Points in time to which the stored time series are related. Should be within the time horizon defined in the sheet "timesystem".
- **timeseries**: Time series of a sink or a source  which has been assigned the property "timeseries" under the attribute "load profile" or
  "technology. Time series contain a value between 0 and 1 for each point in time, which indicates the proportion of installed capacity
  accounted for by the capacity produced at that point in time. In the header line, the name must rather be entered in the format
  "componentID.fix" if the component enters the power system as a fixed component or it requires two columns in the format "componentID.min"
  and "componentID.max" if it is an unfixed component. The columns "componentID.min/.max" define the range that the solver can use for its
  optimization.

Weather Data
------------

If electrical load profiles are simulated with the Richardson tool, heating load profiles with the demandlib or
photovoltaic systems with the feedinlib, weather data must be stored here. The weather
data time system should be in conformity with the model’s time system, defined in the sheet "timesystem".

- **timestamp**: Points in time to which the stored weather data are related. 
- **dhi** in (W/m\ :sup:`2`): Diffuse horizontal irradiance.
- **dni** in (W/m\ :sup:`2`): Direct normal irradiance.
- **ghi** in (W/m\ :sup:`2`): Global horizontal irradiance.
- **pressure** in (Pa): Air pressure.
- **temperature** in (°C): Air temperature.
- **windspeed** in (m/s): Wind speed, measured at 10 m height.
- **z0** in (m): Roughness length of the environment.
- **ground_temp** in (°C): Constant ground temperature at 100 m depth.
- **water_temp** in (°C): Varying water temperature of a river depending on the air temperature.
- **groundwater_temp** in (°C): Constant temperature of the ground water at 6 - 10 m depth in North Rhine-Westphalia.
