Error Message,Possible Error Cause,Debugging
flowsum = source['sequences'].sum() KeyError: 'sequences',A system component was entered incorrectly in the input file.,For all components  make sure that 1) each column is filled correctly  and 2) the first component of a sheet is entered in the row directly below the header row  and that there are no blank rows between the individual components of a sheet
ApplicationError: Solver (cbc) did not exit normally,A system component was entered incorrectly in the input file.,For all components  make sure that 1) each column is filled correctly  and 2) the first component of a sheet is entered in the row directly below the header row  and that there are no blank rows between the individual components of a sheet
df = node_results['sequences'] KeyError: 'sequences',The implemented model probably has an circuit. For example  the excess sink of a bus could achieve higher selling prices than buying from a shortage source. In theory  this could generate an infinitely large profit. Such a model cannot be solved.,Make sure  there are no circuits within the model.
Memory Error,The available memory is not sufficient to solve the model.,Take the following measures gradually until the error no longer occurs: (1) Restart the used Python interpreter (2) Close unnecessary programs on the computer (3) Make sure that python 64 bit version is used (Python 32 bit can manage only 2 GB of memory). (4)Start the program on a computer with a higher memory.
AttributeError: module 'time' has no attribute 'clock',You are using a Python version not compatible with oemof.,Use Pyhton 3.7
ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (8784 ) (8760 ),The weather dataset contains the wrong number of data points for using feedinlib.,Make sure that the number of weather data points corresponds to the time steps of the model (At hourly resolution  one year has 8760 time steps). When simulating a leap year  it is recommended limiting the time horizon to 8760 hours.
ValueError: pyutilib.common._exceptions.ApplicationError: Solver (cbc) did not exit normally,"A value for the use of the investment module (e.g.  ""min Investment Capacity"") was not filled in.",Make sure  that all necessary cells of the spreadsheet have been filled in.
KeyError: '__any component name__',Incorrectly assigned bus name for the input or output of a component,Check that all bus references are correct. Also check for typos.
TypeError: ufunc 'true_divide' not supported for the input types  and the inputs could not be safely,"The column ""annual demand"" was not filled in correctly for a sink.","Make sure to use the ""annual demand"" column for SLP and Richardson sinks and the ""nominal value"" column for time series sinks."
coerced to any supported types according to the casting rule ''safe'',,
AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'is_variable_type',The cost value for an activated excess sink or shortage source was not correctly specified in the bus sheet,Make sure that all excess/sortage prices consist of real numbers. Also check for typos.
Implicitly replacing the Component attribute equate_InvestmentFlow.invest[districtheat_undirected_link districtheat_bus]_InvestmentFlow.invest[ districtheat_undirected_link heat_bus] (type=<class 'pyomo.core.base.constraint.SimpleConstraint'>) on block Model with a new Component (type=<class 'pyomo.core.base.constraint.AbstractSimpleConstraint'>). This is usually indicative of a modelling error. To avoid this warning  use block.del_component() and block.add_component().,
,This is no user error because this error is due to the way undirected links are implemented,,
