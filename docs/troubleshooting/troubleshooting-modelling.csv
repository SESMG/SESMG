Error Message,Possible Error Cause,Debugging
flowsum = source['sequences'].sum() KeyError: 'sequences',A system component was entered incorrectly in the input file.,For all components  make sure that 1) each column is filled correctly  and 2) the first component of a sheet is entered in the row directly below the header row  and that there are no blank rows between the individual components of a sheet
ApplicationError: Solver (cbc) did not exit normally,A system component was entered incorrectly in the input file.,For all components  make sure that 1) each column is filled correctly  and 2) the first component of a sheet is entered in the row directly below the header row  and that there are no blank rows between the individual components of a sheet
df = node_results['sequences'] KeyError: 'sequences',The implemented model probably has an circuit. For example  the excess sink of a bus could achieve higher selling prices than buying from a shortage source. In theory  this could generate an infinitely large profit. Such a model cannot be solved.,Make sure  there are no circuits within the model.
Memory Error,The available memory is not sufficient to solve the model.,Take the following measures gradually until the error no longer occurs: (1) Restart the used Python interpreter (2) Close unnecessary programs on the computer (3) Make sure that python 64 bit version is used (Python 32 bit can manage only 2 GB of memory). (4)Start the program on a computer with a higher memory.
AttributeError: module 'time' has no attribute 'clock',You are using a Python version not compatible with oemof.,Use Pyhton 3.7
ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (8784 ) (8760 ),The weather dataset contains the wrong number of data points for using feedinlib.,Make sure that the number of weather data points corresponds to the time steps of the model (At hourly resolution  one year has 8760 time steps). When simulating a leap year  it is recommended limiting the time horizon to 8760 hours.
ValueError: pyutilib.common._exceptions.ApplicationError: Solver (cbc) did not exit normally,"A value for the use of the investment module (e.g.  ""min Investment Capacity"") was not filled in.",Make sure that all necessary cells of the spreadsheet have been filled in.
KeyError: '__any component name__',Incorrectly assigned bus name for the input or output of a component,Check that all bus references are correct. Also check for typos.
TypeError: ufunc 'true_divide' not supported for the input types  and the inputs could not be safely coerced to any supported types according to the casting rule ''safe'',"The column ""annual demand"" was not filled in correctly for a sink.","Make sure to use the ""annual demand"" column for SLP and Richardson sinks and the ""nominal value"" column for time series sinks."
AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'is_variable_type',The cost value for an activated excess sink or shortage source was not correctly specified in the bus sheet,Make sure that all excess/sortage prices consist of real numbers. Also check for typos.
Implicitly replacing the Component attribute equate_InvestmentFlow.invest[districtheat_undirected_link districtheat_bus]_InvestmentFlow.invest[ districtheat_undirected_link heat_bus] (type=<class 'pyomo.core.base.constraint.SimpleConstraint'>) on block Model with a new Component (type=<class 'pyomo.core.base.constraint.AbstractSimpleConstraint'>). This is usually indicative of a modelling error. To avoid this warning  use block.del_component() and block.add_component().,,This is no user error because this error is due to the way undirected links are implemented
KeyError: 'Index \'(''<oemof.solph.network.source.Source: \'ID_phtovoltaic_electricity_source\'>' ''<oemof.solph.network.bus.Bus: \'ID_pv_bus\'>'' 0)\' is not valid for indexed component \'flow\'', You probably named the busses incorrectly., Check if all busses are named correctly.
KeyError: 'ID_photovoltaik_electricity_source', In this case - PV sources were deactivated although they were still addressed in the area competition, Make sure that if you have disabled pv sources - you do the same for the competition constraint.
UserWarning: Optimization ended with status warning and termination condition infeasible, the model is not solvable - probably because not enough energy is inserted to sattisfy the energy demand, make sure that the sources are able to insert enough energy to the system
Flow: ID_electricity_to_ID_hp_electricity_bus-ID_electricity_bus. This could be caused by NaN-values in your input data.,You have probably used not allowed special characters (e.g. m³), Make sure you have not used any special characters (e.g., use m3 instead of m³)
FutureWarning: Current default for 'dyn_function_h0' is 'False'. This is about to change to 'True'. Set 'False' explicitly to retain the current behaviour.,  the wrong version of the feedinlib is used, make sure you are using feedinlib==0.0.12
 ... in create_flow_dataframes for index; value in component['sequences'].sum().items(): KeyError: 'sequences', You have probably entered an invalid "transformer type" within the transformers sheet, check and correct the transformer types entered to the sheet
AssertionError: Time discretization of irradiance is different from timestep 3600seconds . You need to change the resolution; first!, For the application of the richardson tool a weather dataset of a full year is required, Add a full year weather data set to the weather data sheet.
Possible duplicate uids/labels?,two components of the model are having the same name,rename at least one of the components
,,
ValueError: Length mismatch: Expected axis has 1 elements; new values have 8760 elements Flow: ID_pv_to_ID_electricity_link-ID_pv_bus. This could be caused by NaN-values in your input data., The model probably isn't solvable; because of wrong energybalance., Activate necessary excesses sinks and shortages sources. 
ERROR: Solver (gurobi) returned non-zero return code (1),,reinstall the pyomo-package: 1. open a terminal 2. navigate to your SESMG folder 3. navigate to the scripts-subfolder: "cd Scripts" 4. start the virtual environment: ``start /b activate.bat`` 5. reinstall pyomo: ``pip install pyomo==5.7.1``
df = node_results['sequences'] KeyError: 'sequences'  , The model may possibly have an over or under supply. This will break the calculation., The bus of the oversupply or undersupply can be localized by activating excess or shortage.
