Additional Features
*********

There are additional features available that can be used with the SESMG, but are currently not represented in the GUI.

SESMG-Data
===========
The program SESMG-Data automizes the Data-Processing for Energy System Models. The basis for this restructuring is a database that contains multiple .csv files and can 
be used automatically to create different outputs that are later needed in the automated modeling process of urban energy systems.
The goal of the program is to implement a comprehensive database that minimizes the risk of errors by providing a centralized repository of information.
Further information about installation and usage can be found in the README  `here <https://github.com/SESMG/SESMG-Data/blob/Merged_program/README.md>`_.
