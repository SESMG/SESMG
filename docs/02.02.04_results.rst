.. warning::

	If a time series preparation algorithm was applied for the (main-)model, not
	every time-step of the model was modeled. This must be considered when
	analysing *energy amounts*. Simplifying, it can be assumed that the modeled
	amount of energy multiplied by the variable cost factor (see methods section)
	corresponds to the actual  amount of energy over the entire period. Changes
	in the cost structure, on the other hand, are taken into account
	automatically.

Interactive Results
-------------------

You will be automatically directed to this page after the optimization process
(1) or you may want to analyze existing results (2) again.

1. Result processing after optimization process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The results differ depending on whether you used only one optimization
criterion (a) or whether you did a multi-criteria optimization (b).

1a. Single-criteria optimization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In a single-criteria optimization, the costs, emissions, and energy demands
of the neighborhood are displayed. In addition, you can view the system graph
and all building-specific load profiles via the interactive results.

1b. Multi-criteria optimization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In multi-criteria optimization, several scenarios are calculated. For more
information take a look at the method: `Modeling Method <https://spreadsheet-energy-system-model-generator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/01.02.00_multi_criteria_optimization.html>`_.
For each scenario, the results described for a single-criteria optimization can
be displayed by selecting the reduction of the scenario (see (1) figure below).
In addition, a Pareto diagram and energy amount diagrams are displayed (see (2)
figure below).

2. Result processing of existing results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The difference is that you need to select a folder that you want to analyze.


Results as Spreadsheets and Log-Files
-------------------------------------

The results of the modeling are stored in the SESMG result folder which is
places by default in the /users/documents/SESMG/result directory. The directory
is created by the SESMG application. You can change the directory when you are
using the advanced installation by following the `note information in the installation
description <https://spreadsheet-energy-system-model-generator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/02.01.00_installation.html#extended-installation>`_.

The results are saved in two formats:
- as summarizing log files
- as detailed csv-files.

- The **components.csv** file provides an overview of the technologies included in the model. The columns show the energy quantities, the power to be installed, the costs and the emissions.

- The **results.csv** file presents the values for the specified analysis period for each timestep. It is generated for all oemof-components.
- The **summary.csv** file contains the summary of the results, which can also be found in the output interface.

- The **consumers_exergy** and **consumers_anergy** files contain the consumers that are connected to the exergy or anergy network.
- The **producers_exergy** and **producers_anergy** files contain the producers that are connected to the exergy or anergy network.
- The files **pipes_exergy** and **pipes_anergy** contain the pipe sections of the energy and anergy network. The length of the pipes is included, as well the information which forks are connected.
- The files **forks_exergy** and **forks_anergy** contain information abourt the coordinates of the forks of the networks. Forks are the junctions of the heat networks.
