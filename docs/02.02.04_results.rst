.. warning::

	If a time series preparation algorithm was applied for the (main-)model, not
	every time-step of the model was modeled. This must be considered when
	analysing *energy amounts*. Simplifying, it can be assumed that the modeled
	amount of energy multiplied by the variable cost factor (see methods section)
	corresponds to the actual  amount of energy over the entire period. Changes
	in the cost structure, on the other hand, are taken into account
	automatically.

Interactive Results
-------------------

You will be automatically directed to this page after the optimization process
(1) or you may want to analyze existing results (2) again.

1. Result processing after optimization process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The results differ depending on whether you used only one optimization
criterion (a) or whether you did a multi-criteria optimization (b).

1a. Single-criteria optimization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In a single-criteria optimization, the costs, emissions, and energy demands
of the neighborhood are displayed. In addition, you can view the system graph
and all building-specific load profiles via the interactive results.

1b. Multi-criteria optimization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In multi-criteria optimization, several scenarios are calculated. For more
information take a look at the method: `Modeling Method <https://spreadsheet-energy-system-model-generator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/01.02.00_multi_criteria_optimization.html>`_.
For each scenario, the results described for a single-criteria optimization can
be displayed by selecting the reduction of the scenario (see (1) figure below).
In addition, a Pareto diagram and energy amount diagrams are displayed (see (2)
figure below).

2. Result processing of existing results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The difference is that you need to select a folder that you want to analyze.


Results as Spreadsheets and Log-Files
-------------------------------------

The results of the modeling are stored in the SESMG result folder which is
places by default in the /users/documents/SESMG/result directory. The directory
is created by the SESMG application. You can change the directory when you are
using the advanced installation by following the `note information in the installation
description <https://spreadsheet-energy-system-model-generator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/02.01.00_installation.html#extended-installation>`_.

The results are saved in two formats:
 - as summarizing log files
 - as detailed xlsx-files and csv-files.

The log-file gives an overview of which components are created and which of the
investment options should be implemented. The other files are explained in the following chapters.
If you need more specified results, feel free to contact us as we have experience with different result summaries.


1. Results for a single-criteria optimization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1a. components.csv
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The components.csv file provides detailed information about all components within the modeled energy system. 

.. csv-table:: Exemplary result of electricity shortage of the components.csv
   :header: ID,type,input 1/kWh,input 2/kWh,output 1/kWh,output 2/kWh,capacity/kW,variable costs/CU,periodical costs/CU,investment/kW,max. invest./kW,constraints/CU

   ID_electricity_bus_shortage,source,0,0,52.91,0,0.93,1158.78,0,0,0,1830873.62

This file includes key parameters such as energy flows, capacities, costs, investments, and constraints. Below is a description
of each column in the file.

- input 1/kWh and input 2/kWh: These columns represent the energy flows entering the component during the analyzed time
  period (if a timeseries simplification is selected this column contains only the summed up energy flows for the
  selected time frame).
- output 1/kWh output 2/kWh: These columns capture the energy flows exiting the component during the specified time
  period (if a timeseries simplification is selected this column contains only the summed up energy flows for the
  selected time frame). If multiple outputs exist the order follows the description of the flows in the model definition.
- capacity/kW:
	 - For non-storage components: This represents the maximum energy throughput, which is typically either the highest
	   energy output or the highest energy input, measured in kilowatts (kW) for a one-hour period (see results.csv). This
	   capacity can be either thermal or electrical, depending on the output 1 of the component. For most
	   components this value is identical with the investment (exception for photovoltaic and solar thermal system).
	 - For storage components: The capacity is represented in kilowatt-hours (kWh) instead of kilowatts (kW). This value
	   indicates the total energy storage capacity of the component.
- variable costs/CU and periodical costs/CU: These costs are expressed in Cost Units (CU) and are calculated for a
  one-year period. If a time series simplification is applied, these costs are scaled up for the whole year.
- investment/kW: The investment corresponds to the actual usable power or the nominal power of the technology in kW.
- max. invest./kW: This value is derived from the model definition and represents the upper investment limit of a
  specific component during the optimization process.
- constraints/CU: Constraints are expressed in Cost Units (CU) and are typically calculated over a one-year period.
  If the constraint value is negative, and it refers to GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions, this indicates the reduction
  of emissions due to the usage of renewable energy sources, as per "consumption-based emission accounting". If a time
  series simplification is applied, these costs are scaled up for the whole year.

1b. modified_model_definition.xlsx
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The modified_model_definition is a copy of the sheets of the model definition that are potentially effected by a
timeseries simplification. This includes the "weather data", the "timeseries", the "energysystem", the "sinks" and the
"buses".
The sheets "weather data" and "timeseries" contain all information about the weather or potential timeseries for each
selected time step. If no timeseries simplification is selected, data for each hour of the year (8760 time steps) is
displayed here.

1c. results.csv
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For all components incoming and outgoing energy flows are specified for each time step of the model in kWh. The time
steps include all hours of the year chosen by the timeseries simplification (if no timeseries simplification is chosen,
results for each hour of the year are displayed).

1d. summary.cvs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The summary.csv contains the most important summarized results for the entire optimization.

.. csv-table:: Exemplary result of the summary.csv 
   :header: Start Date,End Date,Resolution,Total System Costs,Total Constraint Costs,Total Variable Costs,Total Periodical Costs,Total Energy Demand,Total Energy Usage

   01.01.2012,05.01.2012 23:00,h,4295.21,5481898.26,2736.69,1558.52,861.77,209.21

- Total System Costs: The total costs over the course of a year, representing the sum of all variable costs (Total
  Variable Costs) and periodical costs (Total Periodical Costs).
- Total Constraint Costs: The total constraint-related costs over the year (in the unit of the chosen constraint).
- Total Variable Costs: Costs that vary depending on the energy quantities (these costs are not longer variable costs
  as they are already summed up for the whole year).
- Total Periodical Costs: The sum of all periodical costs accumulated over the year.
- Total Energy Demand: The demand represents the total amount of energy required by the various components of the
  energy system. In particular, the energy demanded by sinks (consumers) is recorded here (This value is not summed of
  for the entire year if a timeseries simplification is selected).
- Total Energy Usage: The usage represents the amount of energy provided by the sources (Sources) in the system to
  meet the demand. Additionally, excess energy (Excess) is subtracted from Total Usage to reflect the actual
  energy consumption (This value is not summed of for the entire year if a timeseries simplification is selected).

1e. flow_information.cvs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The flow_information.csv file provides a detailed description of all flows listed in both the components.csv and the
result table displayed in the GUI. It contains the name of each flow associated with each component, making it possible
to distinguish between the different inputs and outputs (columns: Flow Input 1, Flow Input 2, Flow Output 1, Flow Output 2).
For example, it becomes clear which input of a heat pump is associated with electricity.

2. Results for a Single-criteria optimization with district heating
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If district heating is included in the optimization options additional result files are created.

- The **consumers_exergy** and **consumers_anergy** files contain the consumers that are connected to the exergy or anergy network.
- The **producers_exergy** and **producers_anergy** files contain the producers that are connected to the exergy or anergy network.
- The files **pipes_exergy** and **pipes_anergy** contain the pipe sections of the energy and anergy network. The length of the pipes is included, as well the information which forks are connected.
- The files **forks_exergy** and **forks_anergy** contain information abourt the coordinates of the forks of the networks. Forks are the junctions of the heat networks.
- The file **district_heating.jpeg** provides a 2D view of the designed heating network. You can see the distribution network, the house connection pipes, the forks, consumers and producers.


3. Multi-criteria optimization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If a multi-criteria optimization is chosen each optimization run is saved with its specific results under the name of the
model definition with the percentage of the constraint (0 for cost optimization, between 0 and 1 for the different
Pareto points and 1 for the constraint cost optimization). The model_definitions with the constraint of the
different runs (between 0 and one) are saved. Additionally, the following results are summarized for the
different runs:

3a. elec_amounts.csv
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This file contains the electricity amounts of the different optimization runs. The column "reductionco2" indicates the
Pareto run, the "Electricity Demand" represents the total demand over the period of one year and the other columns
represent the electricity outputs of the different components of the energy system. The unit of the electricity
amounts is kWh.

3b. heat_amounts.csv
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This file contains the heat amounts of the different optimization runs. The column "reductionco2" indicates the
Pareto run, the "Heat Demand" represents the total demand over the period of one year and the other columns
represent the heat outputs of the different components of the energy system. The unit of the heat
amounts is kWh.

3c. pareto.csv
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The file contains the summarized Total System Costs and Total Constraint Costs from the summary.csv of each run and is
also used to display the Pareto front in the GUI.
