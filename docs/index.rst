The Spreadsheet Energy System Model Generator 
=================================================

The Spreadsheet Energy System Model Generator allows the modeling 
and optimization of energy systems without the need for programming skills. 
The components defined in this spreadsheet are defined with the 
included Python program and the open source Python library "oemof", assembled 
to an energy system and optimized with the open source solver "cbc". The modeling 
results can be viewed and analyzed using a browser-based results output.
