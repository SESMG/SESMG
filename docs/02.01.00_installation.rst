Windows users can finde the versions here: `Python download page for windows <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>`_

.. note:: 

	Make sure to use the installer referring to your windows version (e.g. "Windows x86-64 executable installer" for windows 64-bit version). You can check the build in bit version following `these steps <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/32-bit-and-64-bit-windows-frequently-asked-questions-c6ca9541-8dce-4d48-0415-94a3faa2e13d>`_.

The gurobi solver may be used as **alternative** to the cbc-solver. Be aware, that the gurobi-solver is not open-source and a license is required. However, the gurobi may be faster for certain types of optimization problems, especially for those containing binary decisions. The installation procedure of the gurobi solver is described in detail here: https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/quickstart.html


5. Execute the windows_installation.cmd and add your python version (this may take several minutes).

	If you receive a "Your computer has been protected by Windows" error message, click "More Information," and then "Run Anyway".


MacOS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Install Python (version 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9) 

Go to the `Python download page for macOS <https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/>`_ and download an installer.

.. note:: 

	Make sure to use the installer referring to your chip (Intel-only or universal2) version (e.g. "macOS 64-bit universal2 installer" for mac with Apple M1 / M2). You can check the kind of buil in chip by opening the "About this Mac" option behind the apple icon in the above left corner.

Execute the installer on your computer.

.. note:: 

	Make sure to select "Add pyton to PATH" at the beginning of the Python installation.
	

2. Download the Spreadsheet Energy System Model Generator from `GIT <https://github.com/SESMG/SESMG/tree/master>`_ as .zip folder.

.. note:: 

	If your device does not have homebrew installed, install it by typing ``/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`` in your terminal.
	
.. note:: 

	Homebrew requires Xcode command line tools for macOS. Check if you already have it installed by using ``xcode-select --help``. If no error occures it is already installed. Otherwise run ``xcode-select --install`` in your terminal.

3. Extract the .zip folder into any directory on the computer.
	
4. Excecute the "MacOS_installation.command" file and enter your python version to the terminal.

.. note::

	During this step, the cbc solver was automatically installed. The gurobi solver may be used as **alternative** to the cbc solver. Be aware, that the gurobi-solver is not open-source and a license is required. However, the gurobi may be faster for certain types of optimization problems, especially for those containing binary decisions. The installation procedure of the gurobi solver is described in detail here: https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/quickstart.html

5. The Spreadsheet Energy System Model Generator has been installed. Have fun with the SESMG.

.. note::

	When running the SESMG for the first time using the Run_SESMG_for_macos.command file you may need to conform again, as described above, in the security settings.

Linux 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Install Python (version 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9)

- go to `<https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-python-3-ubuntu/>`_
- use Python3.7 instead of Python3.8

.. note::
	
	Make sure that the alias python3 is set to Python3.7.x.
	If not use update-alternatives to change it and test ist afterwards.
	
1.1 Update alternatives:

``$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.7 2``

1.2 Testing:

``$ python3 --version``
	 
2. Download the Spreadsheet Energy System Model Generator from `GIT <https://github.com/SESMG/SESMG/tree/master>`_ as .zip folder.

3. Extract the .zip folder into any directory on the computer.

4. Install PIP 

``$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip``

5. Install tkinter 

``$ sudo apt-get install python3.7-tk``
	
6. Install Graphviz

``$ sudo apt-get install graphviz``
	
7. Install the CBC Solver 

``$ sudo apt-get install coinor-cbc``

The gurobi solver may be used as **alternative** to the cbc solver. Be aware, that the gurobi-solver is not open-source and a license is required. However, the gurobi may be faster for certain types of optimization problems, especially for those containing binary decisions. The installation procedure of the gurobi solver is described in detail here: https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/quickstart.html
	
8. Execute the "Linux_installtion.sh" file. By first going to the path of the SESMG directory and then running the following:

``$ sudo sh Linux_installation.sh``

9. The Spreadsheet Energy System Model Generator has been installed.
