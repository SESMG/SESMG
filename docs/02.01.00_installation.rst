Installation
************

There are two possible ways to install the SESMG application. It can chosen 
between the installation as an independent **application**, which is appropriate 
for common users, and an installation for advanced users or developers. We 
recommend the installation as an independent application for the beginning. 
You can easily switch later on.

We recommend the **extended installation** which will create the SESMG with its
folder structure on your machine allowing you to work on it or adjust settings. 
You can follow the `extended installation instructions <https://spreadsheet-energy-system-model-generator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/02.01.00_installation.html#extended-installation>`_ 
below. If you have programming experience and want to set your own virtual 
environment (e. g. allowing the usage of Anaconda enviroments) you can follow 
`advanced installation instructions <https://spreadsheet-energy-system-model-generator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/02.01.00_installation.html#advanced-installation>`_. 


Extended Installation
=====================

Windows
-----
