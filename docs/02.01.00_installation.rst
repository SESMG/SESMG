The gurobi solver may be used as **alternative** to the cbc-solver. Be aware, that the gurobi-solver is not open-source and a license is required. However, the gurobi may be faster for certain types of optimization problems, especially for those containing binary decisions. The installation procedure of the gurobi solver is described in detail here: https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/quickstart.html


5. Execute the windows_installation.cmd and add your python version (this may take several minutes).
