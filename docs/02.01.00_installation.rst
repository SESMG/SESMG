Installation
************

There are two possible ways to install the SESMG application. It can chosen 
between the installation as an independent **application**, which is appropriate 
for common users, and an installation for advanced users or developers. We 
recommend the installation as an independent application for the beginning. 
You can easily switch later on.

We recommend the **extended installation** which will create the SESMG with its
folder structure on your machine allowing you to work on it or adjust settings. 
You can follow the `extended installation instructions <https://spreadsheet-energy-system-model-generator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/02.01.00_installation.html#extended-installation>`_ 
below. If you have programming experience and want to set your own virtual 
environment (e. g. allowing the usage of Anaconda enviroments) you can follow 
`advanced installation instructions <https://spreadsheet-energy-system-model-generator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/02.01.00_installation.html#advanced-installation>`_. 



SESMG as Application
====================

Windows
-------

1. Installing Python (3.8 or 3.9)
Windows users can download the preferred version here: `Python download page for windows <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>`_.

.. note:: 

	Make sure to use the installer referring to your windows version (e.g. 
	"Windows x86-64 executable installer" for windows 64-bit version). You can 
	check the build in bit version following `these steps <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/32-bit-and-64-bit-windows-frequently-asked-questions-c6ca9541-8dce-4d48-0415-94a3faa2e13d>`_.
	
.. note:: 

	The SESMG is not compatible with the python version 3.9.7, due to a 
	confliciting bug in this version to the subpackage streamlit. You need to 
	install another pyhton version or update to another python version e. g. 
	3.9.13, which is widely tested.

3. Installing a solver

3a. The free and open-source CBC-solver is recommended for new users and users which are not facing any run-time issues. To use the solver, the following steps must be carried out:

	- if not already existing, create a folder called "SESMG" in the following directory: "/users/<your username>/documents/"
	- download the most recent CBC-version for your operating system: `cbc solver for windows <https://www.coin-or.org/download/binary/Cbc/>`_. Alternatively you can uses the `direct download link 		  <https://www.coin-or.org/download/binary/Cbc/Cbc-2.10-win64-msvc16-mdd.zip>`_
	- unzip the downloaded folder
	- copy the "cbc.exe" (stored in the "bin" directory of the unziped folder) file into the following directory: "/users/<your username>/documents/SESMG"

3b. The gurobi-solver may be used as an **alternative** to the CBC-solver. Be 
aware, that the gurobi-solver is not open-source and a license is required. 
However, the gurobi-solver may be faster for certain types of optimization problems, 
especially for those containing binary decisions. The installation procedure of 
the gurobi-solver is described in detail `here <https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/quickstart.html>`_.  


4. Installing the SESMG application
The latest released SESMG version can be accessed here: `SESMG releases on Github <https://github.com/SESMG/SESMG/releases/latest/>`_. 
Download the SESMG.exe and place it in a directory of your choice. Open the SESMG application by running SESMG.exe. The starting process usually takes a few minutes.

.. tip::

	With the first use you may have to confirm in windows-defender or other protection software that the SESMG is trustworthy. 
	The exact warning message may differ depending on the system language and anti-virus software.


.. tip::

	While the SESMG is starting, a message like "the website is not available" may appear. Wait a moment and press "reload". If necessary, repeat this step. 
	The exact warning message may differ depending on the system language and applied browser.

	
.. note:: 

	The application will create a SESMG directory when starting the first model 
	run. By default it will be created in the /user/documents/ directory as 
	/SESMG.



MacOS
-----

1. Installing Python (3.8 or 3.9) 
Mac users can download the installer for the preferred version here: `Python download page for MacOS <https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/>`_. 
Execute the installer on your computer.

.. note:: 

	Make sure to use the installer referring to your chip (Intel-only or 
	universal2) version (e.g. "macOS 64-bit universal2 installer" for mac with 
	Apple M1 / M2). You can check the kind of build in chip by opening the 
	"About this Mac" options.
	
.. note:: 

	The SESMG is not compatible with the python version 3.9.7, due to a 
	confliciting bug in this version to the subpackage streamlit. You need to 
	install another pyhton version or update to another python version e. g. 
	3.9.13, which is widely tested.

   :align: center

Be aware that it can take several minutes and will be running withouth any 
loading or progress screen. Check your taskmanager to be sure the process 
startet by looking for SESMG.

.. warning::

    A known issue for macOS is that the programm does not close when you close 
    the app. To kill all processes you need to use your taskmanager and stop 
    the "SESMG"-processes manually. Make sure to kill it after each session. 
    Otherwise you will not be able to reopen it by using the way described 
    above. 
    The problem is caused by a subpackage. We are working on a better 
    solution!
