1. Fill in the spreadsheet document according to the instructions in the "Scenario Spreadsheet" chapter.

2. Execute the Run_SESMG_for_**your operating System** file in the main folder.


.. note:: 

	If you receive a "Your computer has been protected by Windows" error message or a similiar one, click "More Information," and then "Run Anyway" (or your operating system specific way to run the programm anyway).

   The display may vary depending on the operating system. The function "Switch Criteria" is not completely implemented.


Description of the GUI functions

Select the xlsx-scenario to be executed.

**With the result processing parameters one has the possibility to decide,**

	- whether xlsx files should be created or not (1) 
	- whether a console log should be created or not (2)
	- whether the Plotly Dash should be created or not (3)

Now there are three functions for eventing with the scenario choosen:
 1. Displays the currently selected xlsx-scenario as graph.
 2. Modeling and optimization of the selected xlsx-scenario with subsequent output of results.  
 3. Display of the latest optimized scenario (only can be used if an optimization run was done in the current session).
 
The functions under the topic **Results** are used to analyze results older then the current session:
 1. Choose the results directory of the results to be displayed.
 2. Execute the programm to start plotly dash.

 
 .. note::
	The detailed modelling results are also stored within the "results" folder.

**Time Series Preparation:**


Depending on which of the time series preparation algorithms described in the methods section is used, the following specifications must be made:

* **Algorithm**: Indication of the simplification algorithm to be applied.

* **Index**: Algorithm specific configuration.

* **Criterion**: Criterion according to which cluster algorithms are applied.

* **Period**: Time periods which are clustered together (weeks, days, hours)

* **Season**: Time periods within which clustering takes place (year, seasons, months)

The following algorithms are applicable and must be specified with the following additional information. A detailed description of the algorithms can be found in the methods section.

**Pre-Modeling:**


For the pre-modeling as described in the methods section, the following specifications must be made:

* **Active**: Must be checked, if pre-modeling should be carried out.

* **Time series preparation parameters**: Timeseries-preparation specifications for the *pre-model* must be given.

* **Investment Boundaries**: Must be checked, if "tightening of technical boundaries" should be carried out.

* **Investment Boundary Factor**: Factor to which the investment
