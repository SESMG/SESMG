1. Fill in the spreadsheet document according to the instructions in the "Scenario Spreadsheet" chapter.

2. Execute the Run_SESMG_for_**your operating System** file in the main folder.


.. note:: 

	If you receive a "Your computer has been protected by Windows" error message or a similiar one, click "More Information," and then "Run Anyway" (or your operating system specific way to run the programm anyway).

   The display may vary depending on the operating system. The function "Switch Criteria" is not completely implemented.


Description of the GUI functions

Select the xlsx-scenario to be executed.

**With the result processing parameters one has the possibility to decide,**

	- whether xlsx files should be created or not (1) 
	- whether a console log should be created or not (2)
	- whether the Plotly Dash should be created or not (3)

Now there are three functions for eventing with the scenario choosen:
 1. Displays the currently selected xlsx-scenario as graph.
 2. Modeling and optimization of the selected xlsx-scenario with subsequent output of results.  
 3. Display of the latest optimized scenario (only can be used if an optimization run was done in the current session).
 
The functions under the topic **Results** are used to analyze results older then the current session:
 1. Choose the results directory of the results to be displayed.
 2. Execute the programm to start plotly dash.

 
 .. note::
	The detailed modelling results are also stored within the "results" folder.

Interface (Streamlit)
---------------------

The user interface can be used to 

	- create energy system models, 
	- perform optimization and 
	- to process the results.
	
The basis for any application is the so-called *model_definition.xlsx*, wich can be created either manually or automatically. When creating manually, the *model_definition.xlsx* must be filled in as described below (see `model definition`_). In case of automatic creation, the Upscaling-Tool (see `upscaling tool`_) is used. After the *model_definition.xlsx* is filled in, the Main Application (`main application`_) can be started. The structure of the GUI can be seen in the following figure. The sidebar is used to enter input data. The main page is used for description or for displaying results.

1. Adding the model definition
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Here you can upload your *model_definition.xlsx*. After the file has been uploaded, you can theoretically continue with step 5. However, it is useful to make settings to reduce the computing time, since only limited computing resources are available.

2. Preprocessing
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
There are several ways to simplify the model. The method can be found here: `Modeling Method <https://spreadsheet-energy-system-model-generator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/01.03.00_model_simplification.html>`_. In the following, only the application is briefly described.

Timeseries Simplificaton
''''''''''''''''''''''

Depending on which of the time series preparation algorithms described in the methods section is used, the following specifications must be made:

* **Algorithm**: Indication of the simplification algorithm to be applied.
* **Index**: Algorithm specific configuration.
* **Criterion**: Criterion according to which cluster algorithms are applied.
* **Period**: Time periods which are clustered together (weeks, days, hours)
* **Season**: Time periods within which clustering takes place (year, seasons, months)

The following algorithms are applicable and must be specified with the following additional information. A detailed description of the algorithms can be found in the methods section.

	k_means,The k-means algorithm clusters the time periods (see period) in such a way; that the squared deviation of the cluster centers is minimal. From the time periods of one cluster the mean is calculated and returned as reference period of the cluster. For the decision the vector of a single parameter (see criterion) over the period duration is considered.,number of clusters to be considered. The number of clusters equals the number of returned reference days.,Clustering criterion to be considered (temperature; dhi; heat demand; electricity demand),Period length to be clustered (hours; days; or weeks),--
	averaging, successive time periods (e.g. two consecutive days) are averaged and combined into one segment.,number of periods to be averaged,--,length of periods to be averaged (hours; days; weeks),--
	slicing A, every n-th period is **selected and considered** within the modeling, index = n (every n-th period is selected in the modeling),--,length of periods to be sliced (hours; days; weeks),--
	slicing B,every n-th period is **deleted and removed** from the modeling, index = n (every n-th period is removed),--,length of periods to be sliced (hours; days; weeks),--
	downsampling A,Adaption of the temporal *resolution*. Every n-th period (selected by index column) is **used** for the modeling. For example; the resolution can be changed from a 1-hourly to a 3-hourly (index = 3) temporal resolution [1].,index = n (setting the new resolution),--,--,--

	random sampling,a given number of random periods are selected and used as representatives,number of periods to be selected.,--,length of periods to be selected randomly (days or weeks,--


Premodeling Settings
''''''''''''''''''''''

For the premodeling as described in the methods section, the following specifications must be made:

* **Active**: Must be checked, if pre-modeling should be carried out.
* **Time series preparation parameters**: Timeseries-preparation specifications for the *pre-model* must be given.
* **Investment Boundaries**: Must be checked, if "tightening of technical boundaries" should be carried out.
* **Investment Boundary Factor**: Factor to which the investment.
