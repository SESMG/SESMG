Using the Scenario File
*************************************************

For the modeling and optimization of an energy system, parameters for all system components must be given in the model 
generator using the enclosed .xlsx file (editable with Excel, LibreOffice, …). The .xlsx file is divided into nine 
input sheets. In the "timesystem" sheet, general parameters are defined for the time horizon to be examined, in the 
sheets "buses", "sinks", "sources", "transformers", "storages" and "links" corresponding components are defined. In 
the sheet "time series", the performance of individual components can be stored. In the "weather data" sheet, the 
required weather data is stored. When completing the input file, it is recommended to enter the energy system step by 
step and to perform test runs in between, so that potential input errors are detected early and can be localized more 
easily. In addition to the explanation of the individual input sheets, an example energy system is built step by step 
in the following subchapters. The input file for this example is stored in the program folder "examples" and viewed on 
`GIT <https://git.fh-muenster.de/ck546038/spreadsheet-energy-system-model-generator/tree/master/examples>`_. The following units are used throughout:

- capacity/performance in kW,
- energy in kWh,
- angles in degrees, and
- costs in cost units (CU).

Cost units are any scalable quantity used to optimize the energy system, such as euros or grams of carbon dioxide emissions.

=================================================

Within this sheet, the time horizon and the temporal resolution of the model is defined. The following parameters have to be entered:

- **start date**: start of the modelling time horizon. Format: "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss";

- **periods**: Number of periods within the time horizon (one year with hourly resolution equals 8760 periods).

Time Series
=================================================

Within this sheet, time series of components of which no automatically created time series exist, are stored. More

- **timeseries**: Time series of a sink or a source  which has been assigned the property "timeseries" under the attribute "load profile" or "technology. Time series contain a value between 0 and 1 for each point in time, which indicates the proportion of installed capacity accounted for by the capacity produced at that point in time. In the header line, the name must rather be entered in the format "componentID.fix" if the component enters the power system as a fixed component or it requires two columns in the format "componentID.min" and "componentID.max" if it is an unfixed component. The columns "componentID.min/.max" define the range that the solver can use for its optimisation.
