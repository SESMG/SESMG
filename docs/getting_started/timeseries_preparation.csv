k_means,The k-means algorithm clusters the time periods (see period) in such a way; that the squared deviation of the cluster centers is minimal. From the time periods of one cluster the mean is calculated and returned as reference period of the cluster. For the decision the vector of a single parameter (see criterion) over the period duration is considered [1].,number of clusters to be considered. The number of clusters equals the number of returned reference days.,Clustering criterion to be considered (temperature; dhi; heat demand; electricity demand),Period length to be clustered (hours; days; or weeks),--

averaging, successive time periods (e.g. two consecutive days) are averaged and combined into one segment [1].,number of periods to be averaged,--,length of periods to be averaged (hours; days; weeks),--

slicing A, every n-th period is **selected and considered** within the modeling, index = n (every n-th period is selected in the modeling),length of periods to be sliced (hours; days; weeks),--

slicing B,delet every n-th period,n.n.,,,

downsampling A,Adaption of the temporal *resolution*. Every n-th period (selected by index column) is **used** for the modeling. For example; the resolution can be changed from a 1-hourly to a 3-hourly (index = 3) temporal resolution [1].,index = n (setting the new resolution),--,--,--

downsampling B, Adaption of the temporal *resolution*. Every n-th period (selected by index column) is **deleted** for the modeling. ,index = n (determination of the time steps to be deleted),--,--,--
